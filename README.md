# EA-GNAS
I am now writing the paper about this project.

Following is the description of this project.

Coming Soon ! :relaxed: :relaxed: :relaxed:

## Data Preparation
 - HC/SCH data have been already processed in
    `Data/HC_SCH/`

## How to run this project
This project contains one main file as follows:

### Step 1: Searching the proper structure of the graph neural network
`python main_IOAGraph.py `
- Here, you can get the proper model structure.
  - Switch different intelligient optimization algorithms.
- Also, you can train and test the proper model structure.
